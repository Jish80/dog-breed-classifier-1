# Dog Breed Classifier
A fun project to classify dog breeds using deep learning.
By default this project uses the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) to classify dog breeds.

## Getting Started
- Run the `setup.ipynb` to download the dataset and setup folders
- Run the `vgg_model.ipynb` to train classifier and save model weights

#### Notes
- Project uses a pre-trained VGG16 model with Batch Normalization: `vgg16bn.py`
- Training Accuracy: 88.32%
- Validation Accuracy: 76.53%
